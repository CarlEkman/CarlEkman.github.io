## Resume

I love working on great apps and smart solutions, preferably alongside creative, dedicated and inspiring people. I have done so thus far at different companies, ranging from the small startup hustle, to running my own firm, to the international enterprise world.

I’m fluent in Swedish and English, and I enjoy working in an international context. I was born in 1990, I have a Master's degree from Uppsala university since 2014, and I have experience with app development and design since 2011.
