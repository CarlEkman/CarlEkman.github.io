Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an **iOS developer** and **UI/UX designer**, currently working as an engineer at iZettle in Stockholm, Sweden.

I love working on great apps and smart solutions, preferably alongside creative, dedicated and inspiring people.

I'll eventually get around to making something out of this site. In the meantime, here's my resume.
