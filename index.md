Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an **iOS developer** and **UI/UX designer**, currently working as an engineer at iZettle in Stockholm, Sweden.

I love working on great apps and smart solutions, preferably alongside creative, dedicated and inspiring people.

This website is a work in progress and a proper portfolio is underway. In the meantime, here's my resume.
